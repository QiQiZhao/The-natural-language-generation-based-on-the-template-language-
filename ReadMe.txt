All of the code is in PythonGUI.Ipynb

Before run the code, you need to run apache-jena-fuseki-3.12.0\fuseki-server.bat to make sure Apache Jena Fuseki is working. 
Your need to put apache-jena-fuseki-3.12.0 under the path of D:\jupyter notebook workplace\XinProject\. Only in this situation, Apache jena fuseki can work successfully.

In addition, the rdf file and mapping file mentioned in my report are new.nt and new_mapping.ttl
